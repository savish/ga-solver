Genetic Algorithm Equation Solver
==

This is a simple C++ program I wrote.

Phase 1 is an equation solver. It converts regular in-fix notation to Reverse Polish notation (postfix notation) and solves the equation. It works with most operations, regular functions (sine, cosine, sqrt...) and variables as well.

Phase 2 uses a genetic algorihm to deduce equation variable values for simultaneous equations. This phase is coupled with phase one via the fitness function of the algorithm.

The ga folder contains the entire solution.

Compiled in linux [gcc].
